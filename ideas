Current requirements for Final UI Project:

***Get comfortable with Django/HTML/CSS!***


- 5 or 6 different pages
- Base CSS for whole website (other CSS will 'inherit' from this one)
- Home page
- A list of games
- User reviews
- A good text editor for the reviews (markdown, BBcode, etc)
- A search system for games
- Rating system for games
- Reputation system for users
- Clean layout, eye-candy

Interesting Python modules
- python-social-auth (let's people sign in with Google, Facebook, etc.)
- django-taggit (Easy to use tagging module)


Current project layout (models):

#One thing to note: We need to implement the report-counts somehow as well.
